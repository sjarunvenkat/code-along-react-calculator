### Learning Goals:

To understanding the importance of: 

1. re-renders
2. state management
3. breaking down your code into components.

This lab also gives you an opportunity to experiment around `hooks`, that you have learned till now.

### Task:

Your task is to create a simple calculator.

`Constraints`: you should not use any libraries for creating the logic of calculator.

Here is a demo, as how your output should look like. ( the UI may not be `exactly` the same.)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
